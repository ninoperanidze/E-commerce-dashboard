# E-commerce Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data to create a comprehensive dashboard. The goal is to provide an insightful overview of sales, profit, and quantity sold, segmented by year and region. The dashboard further categorizes these metrics by customer segment and product category to highlight general trends in the data.

## Dashboard Features
The dashboard provides a visual representation of e-commerce metrics with the ability to drill down into more detailed views based on various business dimensions:
- **Yearly and Regional Breakdowns**: Overview of sales, profit, and quantity sold by year and region.
- **Customer Segments and Product Categories**: Distribution of metrics by customer segment and product category.
- **Product Subcategories and Customer Segment Details**: Detailed analysis of sales and profit margins by product subcategory and customer segment.

### Interactive Elements
- **Dropdown Menus**: Users can apply filters to the data to view specific metrics.
- **Selection Buttons**: Allows users to toggle between sales, profit, and quantity measures.
